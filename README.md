# Observability Lab: Predictive Auto-Scaling for Kubernetes Workloads

Struggling to keep up with the demands of dynamic Kubernetes environments? Manual scaling is not only time-consuming and

resource bottlenecks and automatically open pull requests to scale applications. This proactive approach minimizes
downtime, helps you to optimize resource utilization, and ensures your applications perform at their best.
