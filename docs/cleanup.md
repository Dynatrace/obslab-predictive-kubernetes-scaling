# Cleanup

Finished exploring? When you're done with the demo, you can easily clean up all the resources created by this Codespace.

- Open a terminal window in your Codespace. 
- Run the cleanup Script by executing `./destroy.sh`.

This will remove the local Kubernetes cluster, Dynatrace resources, and any other artifacts created during the demo.
